## About the bot
A simple Telegram bot for converting **multiple** web pages to PDF format. The user can choose to download the file in standard size or optimized for mobile devices.

## ✨ How the bot works:
1. The user sends text containing several links (as plain text or hyperlinks)
2. The bot converts each link to PDF in order and saves everything into a single archive
3. A zip archive containing all PDF files is sent to the user (If there is only one link, the PDF file is sent directly)

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

**Note:** It is recommended to run the bot on a hosting service or server, as any Telegram bot requires constantly running code for continuous operation.
